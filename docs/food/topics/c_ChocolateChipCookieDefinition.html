<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that originated
in the United States and features chocolate chips as its distinguishing
ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter
and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations
include recipes with other types of chocolate or additional ingredients,
such as nuts or oatmeal.</p>

<div class="section"><p class="p">The chocolate chip cookie was accidentally developed by
Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1930. She owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman,
Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured home cooking
in the 1930s. Her cookbook, <em class="ph i">Toll House Tried and True Recipes</em>, was published in 1936 by M. Barrows; Company, New York. It included
the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie", which rapidly became
a favorite to be baked in American homes.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Nestleâ€™s History of the Cookie</h2><p class="p">Wakefield is said to have been making chocolate cookies and on
running out of regular baker's chocolate, substituted broken pieces
of semi-sweet chocolate from Nestle thinking that they would melt
and mix into the batter. They did not and the chocolate chip cookie
was born. Wakefield sold the recipe to Nestle in exchange for a lifetime
supply of chocolate chips. Every bag of Nestle chocolate chips sold
in North America has a variation of her original recipe printed on
the back. </p>
<p class="p">During WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were
stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages
from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds
of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some
Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters
from around the world asking for her recipe. Thus began the nationwide
craze for the chocolate chip cookie.</p>
